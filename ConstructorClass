*What Is Constructor In Java software development?
*Constructor Is a code block which Is Called and executed at the time of object creation and constructs the values (i.e. data) for 
*object and that's why It Is known as constructor. Each class have default no argument constructor In Java software development 
*language If you have not specified any explicit constructor for that class. In java software development language, Constructor 
*looks like methods but bellow given properties of constructor are differentiate them from the methods. 
*
*
*Constructor Creation Rules
*Name of the constructor must be same as class name in java software development language. Means If your class name Is Student 
*then constructor name must be Student.
*
*Constructor must have not any return types.
*
* What is Constructor Overloading?
*Constructor overloading Is useful when you wants to construct your object In different way or we can say using different number 
*of parameters.Some basic rules of constructor overloading: 
*Two constructors with same arguments are not allowed for constructor overloading.
*You need to use this() keyword to call overloaded constructor.
*If you are calling constructor from overloaded constructor using this() keyword, It must be first statement.
*It is best practice to call constructor from overloaded constructor to make It easy to maintain.
