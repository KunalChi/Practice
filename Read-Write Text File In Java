/*
Many times you will need reading or writing text file In your selenium webdriver software automation test case development. 
For Example, You are reading some large data from web page of software web application and wants to store It In text file to use 
It somewhere else In future. Same way, You have to read data from file for some purpose.It Is very easy to Create, Write and read 
text file In java software development language. We can use java built in class File to create new file, FileWriter and BufferedWriter 
class to write In to file, FileReader and BufferedReader class to read text file.

Public class RW_File {

 public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
  //Create File In D: Driver.  
  String TestFile = "D:\\temp.txt";
  File FC = new File(TestFile);//Created object of java File class.
  FC.createNewFile();//Create file.
  
  //Writing In to file.
  //Create Object of java FileWriter and BufferedWriter class.
  FileWriter FW = new FileWriter(TestFile);
  BufferedWriter BW = new BufferedWriter(FW);
  BW.write("This Is First Line."); //Writing In To File.
  BW.newLine();//To write next string on new line.
  BW.write("This Is Second Line."); //Writing In To File.
  BW.close();
  
  //Reading from file.
  //Create Object of java FileReader and BufferedReader class.
  FileReader FR = new FileReader(TestFile);
  BufferedReader BR = new BufferedReader(FR);
  String Content = "";
  
  //Loop to read all lines one by one from file and print It.
  while((Content = BR.readLine())!= null){
   System.out.println(Content);
