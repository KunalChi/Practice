/*
Selenium provides us with an interface called Alert. It is present in the org.openqa.selenium.Alert package. 
Alert interface gives us following methods to deal with the alert:

accept() To accept the alert
dismiss() To dismiss the alert
getText() To get the text of the alert
sendKeys() To write some text to the alert
Lets use these to handle the above mentioned types of alerts one by one.

/*
Simple alert
Simple alerts just have a OK button on them. They are mainly used to display some information to the user. The first 
alert on our test page is a simple alert. Following code will read the text from the Alert and then accept the alert. 
Important point to note is that we can switch from main window to an alert using the driver.switchTo().alert(). Below 
is the usage of that also
*/

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
		driver.get("http://toolsqa.wpengine.com/handling-alerts-using-selenium-webdriver/");
		driver.manage().window().maximize();
		// This step will result in an alert on screen
		driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id='content']/p[4]/button")).click();

		Alert simpleAlert = driver.switchTo().alert();
		String alertText = simpleAlert.getText();
		System.out.println("Alert text is " + alertText);
		simpleAlert.accept();
    }
